# Instant Payment Notifications (IPN)

## Overview

* PayPal Instant Payment Notification is a call back system that is initiated when a transaction is completed 
  (Example: On successful payment transaction).
* The transaction related IPN variables will be received on the call back URL specified in the request.
* The IPN variables have to be sent back to the PayPal system for validation, 
  upon validation PayPal will send a response string that is either "VERIFIED" or "INVALID".
* PayPal would continuously resend IPN until you acknowledge receipt of the IPN.

## Configuration

* Configure the 'mode' parameter by passing in a dictionary containing the 'mode' parameter as shown below (Skip this if you are configuring 'mode' in Web.config file). See the SDK README file for more on configuration.

		Dictionary<string, string> configMap = new Dictionary<string, string>();

		// Endpoints are varied depending on whether sandbox OR live is chosen for mode
		configMap.Add("mode", "sandbox");

		// These values are defaulted in SDK. If you want to override default values, uncomment it and add your value.
		// configMap.Add("connectionTimeout", "5000");
		// configMap.Add("requestRetries", "2");
		
* A utility class 'IPNMessage.cs' is provided in sdk-core-dotnet for IPN message validation.


## Deployment

* IPN Listener - buttonmanager-sdk-dotnet\Samples\ButtonManagerAPISample\IPNListener.aspx
* Deploy IPN Listener sample in IIS and expose your server port using any third party 
  LocalTunneling software, so that the PayPal IPN call back can be received
* Make a PayPal API call (Example: BMCreateButton request), setting the IPNNotificationUrl field of the API request class
  to the URL of deployed IPNListener sample (Example: http://DNS-Name/IPNListener.aspx)
* The IPN call back from PayPal would be logged in the log file of the IPN sample
